One console to alert groups in real time with private notification to connect & engage with other members of group quickly.

I developed this project while working WebcodeZ Infoway. This application help people when there is robbery/theft attack in house or nearby. When user detect such society threat he/she can alert other members of society silently through android application.

Basically this local project is aimed to provide instant alert interface where one set alert button on all other society members get alerted with one-line message. So they can take action against society threat.

Technologies used : Android API 18-21, REST API, PHP/MySQL.
